Introduction:-
Education system is having many cons due to the upcoming changes affected by AI (Artificial Intelligence). The real time assessment done on Customization bases is helping the Sector to work more smoothly and efficiently. In the earlier system, the educators were not able to give personal attention to all the students present in the class. But gradually, the provision can be modified in a way that it shows which student has done multiple attempts for reaching on to the answer. Also, those students can be highlighted so that the faculties can easily trace them. Then in terms of textbook learning patterns, a provision can be updated wherein a student can highlight any word by double tapping it for further reference. Once the reading gets completed, they can reassess the words by getting to know their meaning. Lastly, in the assessment patterns, there used to be essays, MCQs, short answer type questions being used. This can be modified in a way that the learning architecture can be done on individual teacher or administrator bases. So, this system will help us work smoothly with real time assessments and understanding of all the systems on personal basis.
